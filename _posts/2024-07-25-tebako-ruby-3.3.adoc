= Tebako announces Ruby 3.3 support at v0.780

== General

We are happy to announce full support for Ruby 3.3 in the latest Tebako
release v0.8.0.

This expansion means that now it is possible to use Ruby 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 as bedrocks for tebako packages, making Tebako even more versatile for
your development needs.

By supporting WindowsRuby 3.3, we ensure that a broader audience can take advantage of
Tebakoâ€™s benefits, such as simplified deployment, enhanced security, and
consistent application performance across different environments.

== A short recap of Tebako

Tebako is a specialized tool designed to facilitate the deployment of Ruby
applications with enhanced security and portability. It packages applications
along with their dependencies into a single, self-contained executable with
no external dependencies.

This approach helps mitigate deployment issues related to environment
differences and dependency management, making it easier to ensure that your
application runs smoothly wherever it is deployed.
