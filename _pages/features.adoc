Tebako is an advanced executable packager designed for applications written in
interpretive languages.

It simplifies distribution and deployment by packaging your entire project with
a bundled runtime into a single, performant, executable binary.


== Architecture

A Tebako-packaged binary is effectively a self-executing container-in-a-file.

The packaged binary contains the following components:

* An on-file filesystem (OFFS) containing all the project files and
dependencies in DwarFS format.

* A runtime environment that includes the necessary libraries and interpreters,
with patched filesystem calls that redirect access of project files to the
on-file filesystem.

* An executable loader that loads the on-file filesystem in memory and executes
the project.


== Supported runtimes, platforms and architectures

Tebako artifacts can be built and executed on the following platforms and
architectures.

[NOTE]
====
Windows build caveats:

. Tebako may face errors related to CMake path length limitations
  (https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/25936).
** This error may affect not Tebako itself, but it may affect the gems that need
   to be packaged and use CMake to build native extensions.
** There is no workaround for this issue as it looks like is a limitation of the
   manifest used to build a CMake executable.

. The MSys strip utility creates broken executable when tebako image is processed.
** Linking with '-s' flag produces unusable executables as well.
** Until this issue (#172) is resolved we plan to produce an Windows executable
   with debug information unstripped.
** You can opt to run 'strip -S' manually, it most cases it works.

.Supported Ruby versions

|===
| Ruby version | Supported platforms

| 2.7.8 | Linux, macOS
| 3.0.7 | Linux, macOS
| 3.1.{4,5,6} | Linux, macOS, Windows
| 3.2.{3,4} | Linux, macOS, Windows

NOTE: Our goal is to support all maintained Ruby releases, including minor versions.

== Packaging scenarios for Ruby

Tebako for Ruby supports the following packaging scenarios.

This is high-level description of the Tebako Ruby packaging mechanism.

NOTE: These scenarios were inspired by the `ruby-packer` approach.

NOTE: Tebako Ruby is created independently from `ruby-packer`, no line of code
was copied from `ruby-packer`.

Depending on the configuration files that are present in the root project folder, the Tebako Ruby packager supports different packaging scenarios.

These scenarios differ in what files are packaged and where the entry point is located.

Here is a summary of the scenarios:

[cols="a,2a,4a,3a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Scenario | Description | Packaging | Entry point | `*.gemspec` | `Gemfile`  | `*.gem`

| 1
| Simple ruby script
| Copy `<project-root>` with all sub-folders to packaged filesystem
| `<mount_point>/local/<entry_point base name>`
| No
| No
| No


| 2
| Packaged gem
| Install the gem with `gem install` to packaged filesystem
| `<mount_point>/bin/<entry_point base name>` (i.e., binstub is expected)
| No
| No
| One


| 3
| Gem source, no `bundler`
|
. Build the gem using `gem build` command at the host
. Install it with `gem install` to packaged filesystem

| `<mount_point>/bin/<entry_point base name>` (i.e., binstub is expected)
| One
| No
| Any


| 4
| Gem source, `bundler`
|
. Collect dependencies at the host with `bundle install`
. Build the gem using `gem build` command
. Install it with `gem install` to packaged file system

| `<mount_point>/bin/<entry_point base name>` (i.e., binstub is expected)
| One
| One
| Any


| 5
| Rails project
| Deploy project to packaged filesystem using `bundle install`
| `<mount_point>/local/<entry_point base name>`
| No
| One
| Any


| Error
| Error: Two or more `*.gem` files present
| -
| -
| No
| No
| Two or more


| Error
| Error: Two or more `*.gemspec` files present
| -
| -
| Two or more
| Any
| Any

|===


These scenarios determine how the project is packaged and where the entry point
is located within the packaged filesystem.
