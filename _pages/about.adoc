== Origin

Tebako was originally created to produce a single-binary version of
https://www.metanorma.org[Metanorma],
which uses Ruby.


== Origin of name

"tamatebako" (玉手箱) is the treasure box given to Urashima Taro in the Ryugu,
for which he was asked not to open if he wished to return. He opened the box
upon the shock from his return that three hundred years has passed. Apparently
what was stored in the box was his age.

This packager was made to store Ruby and its gems, and therefore named after
the said treasure box (storing gems inside a treasure box).

Since "tamatebako" is rather long for the non-Japanese speaker, we use "tebako"
(手箱, also "tehako") instead, the generic term for a personal box.
